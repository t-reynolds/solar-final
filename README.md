# solar-final
This program creates a 3-D model of our solar system, in which you can add in your own planets.
Everything inside is exactly to scale, with the correct, proportional physics.
The python library being used is VPython.
# Main.py
Main.py holds the physics model that gives the planets their accuate movement. It also holds the information required to recreate our solar system.

# SolarSystem.py
SolarSystem.py contains the object class for the solar system, as well as a GUI. If the GUI is removed, you can better build your own personal solar system unrelated to ours.
